- the drop down should have the following elements:
    "Display Data Grid 1"
    "Display Data Grid 2"

- the grid should dynamically create the row headers

- the grid should dynamically switch and populate dataset using a onclick from the drop down

    "/test_link?id={id}"

    - all columns should be sortable except for the "source" column on one.json and "requested_amount" in two.json, those 2 columns should not have sortable active

    
    - the column headers should be angled at upwards as to minimize the column width of the table in order to fit withing the page, should look something like this:

         /      /        /      /        /      /        /      /        /      /
        /      /        /      /        /      /        /      /        /      /
       /      /        /      /        /      /        /      /        /      /
